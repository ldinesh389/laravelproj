## E-Prop Tech test

Consume this endpoint https://swapi.dev/api/people/ (full docs available at: https://swapi.dev/) and traverse the data, storing as you go. Display the data in a CRUD and allow the user to overwrite the stored data. Don't spend too long on the project, timebox yourself to 1 hour and see where you get to, focus on the areas where you excel, ready to discuss more fully in the next stage interview.

When it comes to Planets, Spaceships and Vehicles the team only care about the name or title, there's no need to model all the attributes. They are interested in characters that appear in every film, so when displaying a character show an extra icon or banner when they have appeared in every film according to the API.

Note that the introductory text on the API is a little misleading - not all the category names match, and there may not be as many films present as claimed.


### What We Would Like to see
* Recursively traversing data and storing appropriately

* Laravel Migrations

* Caching where appropriate

* Validation

* Authorization 

* Tests where appropriate

* Responsive styling (Tailwind preferred https://tailwindcss.com/)
